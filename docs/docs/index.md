# Ergate

<p align="center">
    <em><b>Ergate</b>: workflows made easy, your way.</em>
</p>


## About

**Ergate** is a fully-typed framework upon which you can build distributed workers to process any given set of steps in a pre-defined order. Instead of restricting your choices to a given set of queues or state stores, **Ergate** simply defines a common set of functions that your queue and state store handlers must implement, leaving the implementation up to you.


## Installation

**Ergate** is available on PyPi, and therefore all you need to do to use it is `pip install` it:
```console
pip install ergate
```


## Example

In this example, we're using a simple Python queue and triggering a Job manually just before running the app. However, the queue and state store implementations are completely up to you as long as they implement the methods shown here.

```py
from queue import Queue
from ergate import Ergate, Job, Workflow


queue: Queue[Job] = Queue()


class MyQueue:
    def get_one(self) -> Job:
        return queue.get()

    def put(self, job: Job) -> None:
        queue.put(job)


class MyStateStore:
    def update(self, job: Job) -> None:
        print(f"Updating {job.id}")


workflow = Workflow(unique_name="my_first_workflow")

@workflow.step
def say_hi() -> None:
    print("Hello world")


@workflow.step
def say_bye() -> None:
    print("Goodbye world")


app = Ergate(queue=MyQueue(), job_state_store=MyStateStore())
app.register_workflow(workflow)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    queue.put(Job(id=1, workflow_name="my_first_workflow"))
    app.run()
```
