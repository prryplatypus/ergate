# Tutorial - user guide

This section will guide you step by step through all of the basic concepts of **Ergate**. You should read through each of the sections in the order that they're displayed in, as they build on top of each other.

Throughout the tutorial, you will encounter different codeblocks; all of which have a header displaying a filename. There are some expectations for you to be able to follow along:

- If it is the first time you encounter a file, create it locally and copy the contents of the codeblock into it.
- If you've encountered a file previously, modify it to match the contents of the latest codeblock.

At the end of some sections you will find a simple challenge. These challenges are meant to help you understand the concepts you've just learned. Remember to check out the solution once you're done, and update your code accordingly.
